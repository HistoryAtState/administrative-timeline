                    <p>An “act to remodel the Diplomatic and Consular Systems of the United States” (10 Stat. 619) attempted to systematize ranks, posts, and salaries in the Diplomatic and Consular Services. All appointees were to be American citizens, all Ministers Resident would become Ministers Plenipotentiary, all legations would have an assigned secretary, and all consular fees would go to the government. The practice of appointing unpaid attachés to diplomatic missions was forbidden. President Franklin Pierce, Secretary of State <ref target="https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/marcy-william-learned">Marcy</ref>, and Attorney General Caleb Cushing concluded that the law imposed unconstitutional restraints on the President’s power of appointment by requiring them to appoint representatives of certain grades to specific countries.</p>
                    <p>The Act divided consulates and commercial agencies into two classes: Schedule B and Schedule C. Schedule B posts had salaries ranging from $1,000 to $7,500; persons assigned to them could not engage in trade. Schedule C posts paid $300 to $1,000; trade was permissible but fees could not be kept. Holders of 30 posts not listed in either schedule could trade and keep their fees. The Act also provided for the appointment of up to 25 “consular pupils,” who were expected to become the nucleus of a professional consular corps. Consuls were to collect receipts for fees received and to report annually on money collected.</p>
                    <p>After passage of the Act, the Department published its first <hi rend="italic">General Instructions to the Consuls and Commercial Agents of the United States.</hi> Future editions of <hi rend="italic">Consular Regulations</hi> were published in 1857, 1870, 1874, 1881, 1888, and 1896.</p>

                    <p>An appropriations act (10 Stat. 669) established four grades of clerks in the Department of State.

                    <p>An “act to regulate the Diplomatic and Consular Systems of the United States” (11 Stat. 52) eliminated the objectionable provisions in the 1855 Act. The President was authorized to prescribe fees for official services. Diplomatic salaries ranged from $10,000 to $17,500; the latter figure remained the maximum salary for an Ambassador until 1946. These were classed as Schedule A. The Schedule B and C system for Consular salaries was continued. The provision for “Consular pupils” remained, but was repealed a year later. Consular accounts were to be audited by the Treasury Department.</p>
                    <p>The Act also gave the Department of State sole authority to issue passports and made it a crime for a Consular officer to issue a passport to a non-citizen (11 Stat. 60).</p>
                    <p>An Act of Congress (11 Stat. 139) created the new position of Superintendent for Statistics and provided for annual publication of reports on foreign commerce. Consuls were required to collect the information. <hi rend="italic">Commercial Relations of the United States</hi> was an annual Department of State publication from 1857 until July 1, 1903, when the Department of Commerce and Labor took charge of it.</p>

In it, Secretary of State <ref target="https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/seward-william-henry">Seward</ref> urged French Emperor Napoleon III not to delay the withdrawal of his forces from Mexico. It cost $2.50 per word to send, but since numbers had to be spelled out, its 780 words counted as 3,772 words. Since the Anglo-American Telegraph Company charged double for coded messages, the entire message cost $19,540.50 to send.

                    <p>The Foreign Service Act (Rogers Act, 43 Stat. 146) combined the Diplomatic and Consular Services into the Foreign Service. A Division of Foreign Service Administration replaced the Diplomatic and Consular Bureaus. There would be nine classes of Foreign Service Officers, with salaries ranging from $3,000 in Class 9 to $9,000 in Class 1. Career vice consuls, consular assistants, interpreters, and student interpreters were placed in an unclassified group, with salaries ranging from $1,500 to $3,000. Appointments would be made after examination and after a probationary period in the unclassified grade. Career officers who had been chiefs of mission could be reinstated. A retirement system was established, as were representation allowances (money was not appropriated for the latter until 1931). Home leave was authorized for officers who had served three years abroad. Foreign Service Inspectors replaced the 1906 Consuls General at Large.</p>
                    <p>Numerical titles for the Assistant Secretaries of State were abolished and the number of Assistant Secretaries was increased to four.</p>

                    <p>The Immigration Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 153) required Consular officers to issue visas to immigrants. Immigration visas were valid for up to four months and were to specify nationality, quota or non-quota status, the expiration date, and any other necessary information. Consular officers were to determine whether or not an applicant was admissible. Immigration quotas were set at 2% of the number of persons of a given nationality who lived in the United States in 1890.</p>

                    <p>Department Order 1218 set forth a reorganization plan that attempted to organize the Department on more functional lines. One Assistant Secretary assumed charge of international economic and financial affairs, replacing the Office of the Adviser on International Economic Affairs. Another assumed charge of administration and public information. A third assumed charge of controls, transportation, and communications. The fourth was responsible for Congressional liaison. An Office of Foreign Service Administration was established under direction of the Assistant Secretary for Administration. The four geographical Divisions became Offices, with the former Advisors on Political Relations becoming Office Directors. An Executive Assistant to the Secretary was established to administer the Secretary’s immediate office while another reviewed correspondence for the Secretary’s signature. The Special Division became the Special War Problems Division. This, along with the Passport, Visa, and Foreign Activity Correlation Divisions, comprised the Office of Controls.</p>
                    <p>Twelve Offices were established to oversee the various Divisions. The Directors of the four geographical offices and a new Office of Special Political Affairs reported to the Under Secretary. The latter organization was charged with preparations for a postwar international organization and included a Division of International Organization Affairs. The Protocol Division was under the Office of Departmental Administration.</p>
                    <p>An Office of Public Information was established, containing Divisions of: Current Information; Research and Publication; Motion Pictures and Radio; and Science, Education, and Art. The Division of Research and Publication replaced the Office of the Editor of Treaties. A Division of Labor Relations was also established.</p>
                    <p>Two organizations were established for long-range planning: the Policy Committee and the Committee on Postwar Programs.</p>
                    <p>The reorganization plan eliminated the Office of the Chief Clerk and Administrative Assistant, transferring its duties to the Division of Administrative Management. The Office of Coordination and Review was also eliminated, but was re-established as part of the Division of Communications and Records a month later. A Central Translating Division replaced the Central Translating Office and the Translating Bureau. The Treaty Division was abolished and its functions transferred to the Legal Adviser’s Office. A Division of Budget and Finance replaced the Division of Accounts and the Office of Fiscal and Budgetary Affairs.</p>
                    <p>Conducted in relative secrecy and haste with little consultation among senior officers of the Department, the January 15 reorganization was subsequently adjusted by 33 Department Orders through December 20.</p>

Terminated employees could still serve in other federal agencies if the Civil Service Commission found them eligible. On June 27, 1947, the Department announced the termination of ten employees. On October 3, the Personnel Security Board recommended that three be permitted to resign without prejudice. The remaining seven were allowed to do so on November 17.</p>

                    <p>The Foreign Service Act of 1946 (60 Stat. 1000) recognized six categories of Foreign Service personnel: Ambassadors and Ministers, Foreign Service Officers (the number of classes was reduced from eleven to seven, with a new grade of Career Minister), Foreign Service Reserve Officers (specialists serving for up to four years), Foreign Service Staff Officers (22 classes of administrative, fiscal, clerical, technical, custodial, and miscellaneous personnel), alien employees, and consular agents.</p>
                    <p>A “selection-out” system was instituted, requiring the resignation of FSOs who were not promoted within a specific period. Retirement age was set at 65 for Career Ministers and 60 for all other FSOs. Voluntary retirement was possible after 20 years’ service after age 50. The allowance system was extended to provide separation allowances when hazardous or unhealthy conditions prevented families from residing at post. Differentials were also authorized for service at dangerous or unhealthy posts. The inspection function was placed under the Assistant Secretary for Administration, and Foreign Service posts were to be inspected every two years by the Foreign Service Inspection Corps.</p>
                    <p>The Act created the position of Director General of the Foreign Service, with rank equivalent to an Assistant Secretary of State. Until 1980, Directors General of the Foreign Service were designated by the Secretary of State. The Foreign Service Act also authorized the Foreign Service Institute, the Board of the Foreign Service, and the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service.</p>
                    <p>Section 562 of the Act authorized the Secretary of the Navy to provide Navy or Marine Corps personnel to serve as “custodians” at overseas missions at the request of the Secretary of State.</p>

                    <p>The Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, chaired by former President Herbert Hoover, concluded a two-year study and submitted its report to Congress. It noted that 45 federal agencies were involved in foreign relations, and that the Department of State spent only 5% of the money and employed only 11% of the civilian federal employees abroad. It recommended the establishment of a single service that would include all Foreign Service and Department personnel above a certain grade. It endorsed the Peurifoy Plan, and recommended the creation of two Deputy Under Secretaries of State. It also recommended Bureau status for the geographic divisions and for the Office of United Nations Affairs, which would be “line units” with action responsibility, as opposed to “staff units” with advisory roles. It also recommended the establishment of a full-time Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations. The Director of the Policy Planning Staff should become a Planning Adviser. The Department then organized three task forces to study the Foreign Service, the Department, and high-level positions.</p>
                    <p>The Hoover Commission Report also recommended that Chiefs of Mission should have “the ultimate authority overseas with respect to foreign affairs aspects of program operations.”</p>

                    <p>A Senate subcommittee chaired by Sen. Millard F. Tydings issued a report denying Sen. Joseph McCarthy’s charges of Communist infiltration of the Department of State.

Another Under Secretary would be responsible for economic affairs and foreign assistance. The Department’s administrative structure would be simplified.

Among its recommendations was that the second-ranking officer in the Department should be a “Deputy Secretary,” who would free the Secretary from “social and ceremonial functions and participation in overseas conferences,” as well as from frequent appearances on Capitol Hill. Thus, the Secretary would be better able to serve as “the director and coordinator, for and on behalf of the President, of all U.S. foreign and national security policy. A senior staff would combine the functions of policy planning, the Executive Secretariat, and the Inspector General. Various functional bureaus would be grouped under two Under Secretaries, for economics and for security affairs. No action was taken on the report before President Johnson left office.</p>

                    <p>Public Law 90-494 (82 Stat. 810) created a Foreign Service Information Officer (FSIO) Corps in the U.S. Information Agency that was modeled on the Foreign Service. The Act created a class of Foreign Service Reserve Officers with unlimited tenure (FSRUs) and also provided for lateral entry into the Foreign Service by Foreign Service Reserve Officers within five years of their original appointments. It also established eight functional categories for Foreign Service personnel: political, political/economic, political/military, economic, economic/commercial, consular, and general administrative. These categories were later known as “tracks” or “cones.” The three political and the two economic categories were consolidated into one of each.</p>

It was later published in the November 1968 issue of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Service Journal</hi> under the title “Toward a Modern Diplomacy.” It recommended the establishment of a “Foreign Secretary” as the second-ranking officer of the Department. As an alter ego of the Secretary, the Foreign Secretary would attend Cabinet meetings. A Permanent Under Secretary would be the third-ranking officer.</p>

                    <p>Secretary of State <ref target="https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/christopher-warren-minor">Warren M. Christopher</ref> announced a reorganization plan. An Under Secretary for Global Affairs would be created to oversee the Bureaus of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor; Narcotics, Terrorism and Crime; Population, Refugees and Migration; and Oceans, Environment and Science. A New Ambassador at Large would be appointed to help manage relations with the former Soviet Republics, while the Ambassadors at Large for Refugee Affairs, Nonproliferation Policy and Nuclear Energy Affairs, and Burdensharing were eliminated. The titles of two more Under Secretaries would be changed to reflect their broader responsibilities: International Security would become “Arms Control and International Security,” and Economic and Agricultural Affairs would become “Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs.” Under Secretaries would get more authority over the bureaus, while the number of Deputy Assistant Secretaries and equivalents would be reduced.</p>
                    <p>The plan drew heavily on “State 2000,” a report prepared by a task force commissioned by former Under Secretary of State <ref target="https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/rogers-john-f-w">John F. W. Rogers</ref> and released in January.</p>

                    <p>The Department of State’s main mail processing center in Sterling, VA (SA-32) was closed after an anthrax-contaminated letter was routed there after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Employee David Hose contracted inhalation anthrax, but recovered. On November 9, a nearby warehouse was designated as SA-32T and became a temporary facility for diplomatic pouch mail. The first outgoing shipments were made on November 20. The Department also organized a three-member Chemical and Biological Working Group to monitor the cleanup and to prepare responses to future terrorist attacks.</p>
                    <p>The cleanup process lasted more than two years and involved the removal and destruction of over 400 tons of equipment and materials.</p>

The ethos was drafted to promote professional qualities and teamwork among Civil Service, Foreign Service, contractors, locally employed staff and non-career employees. The ethos read: “I am a champion of American diplomacy. My colleagues and I proudly serve the United States and the American people at the Department of State, America's first executive department. We support and defend the Constitution of the United States. We protect the American people and promote their interests and values around the world by leading our nation's foreign policy. As a member of this team, I serve with unfailing professionalism in both my demeanor and my actions, even in the face of adversity. I act with uncompromising personal and professional integrity. I take ownership of and responsibility for my actions and decisions. And I show unstinting respect in word and deed for my colleagues and all who serve alongside me. Together, we are the United States Department of State.”</p>

Bulatao</ref>, approved Authorized Departure from any diplomatic or consular post of U.S. direct hire employees or eligible family members who, after confidential consultation with MED, had determined they are at higher risk of a poor outcome if exposed to COVID-19, or who had requested departure based on a commensurate justification in foreign areas. Posts were instructed in 20 STATE 28418 to immediately inform all official U.S. citizen employees and family members of this authority. The Department had already issued a global travel advisory recommending that U.S. citizens reconsider travel abroad. The departure was initially approved for a period not to exceed 60 days. On March 19, 2020, in 20 STATE 30308, Bulatao delegated authority to Regional Executive Directors to designate an official alternate domestic safe haven (anywhere in the 50 United States) for employees who departed post under Authorized (or Ordered) Departure for COVID-19 related reasons. Departing employees could further be approved to telework from alternate worksites at their safe haven locations, subject to procedure. 20 STATE 31358 on March 21 clarified that employees who departed post under Ordered or Authorized Departure to alternate foreign safe havens were not permitted to telework due to a range of considerations, including lack of foreign country accreditation, lack of privileges and immunities for persons working for the U.S. government in a foreign country, and other safety and security considerations.</p>
